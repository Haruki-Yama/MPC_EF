                    Can be applied in the complex domain.

                    Python implementation of the “DOP853” algorithm originally written in Fortran.
                    A 7-th order interpolation polynomial accurate to 7-th order is used for the dense output.
                    Can be applied in the complex domain.
                "Radau":
                    Implicit Runge-Kutta method of the Radau IIA family of order 5.
                    The error is controlled with a third-order accurate embedded formula.
                    A cubic polynomial which satisfies the collocation conditions is used for the dense output.
                "BDF":
                    Implicit multi-step variable-order (1 to 5) method
                    based on a backward differentiation formula for the derivative approximation.
                    A quasi-constant step scheme is used and accuracy is enhanced using the NDF modification.
                    Can be applied in the complex domain.
                "LSODA":
                    Adams/BDF method with automatic stiffness detection and switching.
                    This is a wrapper of the Fortran solver from ODEPACK.

        t_eval (array_like or None, optional):
            Times at which to store the computed solution, must be sorted and lie within t_span.
            If None (default), use points selected by the solver.
        events (callable, or list of callables, optional):
            Events to track. If None (default), no events will be tracked.
            Each event occurs at the zeros of a continuous function of time and state.
            Each function must have the signature event(t, y) and return a float.
            The solver will find an accurate value of t at which event(t, y(t)) = 0 using a root-finding algorithm.
            By default, all zeros will be found. The solver looks for a sign change over each step,
            so if multiple zero crossings occur within one step, events may be missed.
            Additionally each event function might have the following attributes:
                terminal (bool, optional):
                    Whether to terminate integration if this event occurs. Implicitly False if not assigned.
                direction (float, optional):
                    Direction of a zero crossing.
                    If direction is positive, event will only trigger when going from negative to positive,
                    and vice versa if direction is negative.
                    If 0, then either direction will trigger event. Implicitly 0 if not assigned.
            You can assign attributes like `event.terminal = True` to any function in Python.
        vectorized (bool, optional):
            Whether `fun` is implemented in a vectorized fashion. Default is False.
        options:
            Options passed to a chosen solver.

                For each value of t_events, the corresponding value of the solution.
                None if events was None.
            nfev (int):
                Number of evaluations of the right-hand side.

                Number of evaluations of the jacobian.
            nlu (int):
                Number of LU decomposition.

                    - -1: Integration step failed.
                    - 0: The solver successfully reached the end of `tspan`.

                    Implicit multi-step variable-order (1 to 5) method
                    based on a backward differentiation formula for the derivative approximation.
                    A quasi-constant step scheme is used and accuracy is enhanced using the NDF modification.
                    Can be applied in the complex domain.
                "LSODA":
                    Adams/BDF method with automatic stiffness detection and switching.
                    This is a wrapper of the Fortran solver from ODEPACK.

        t_eval (array_like or None, optional):
            Times at which to store the computed solution, must be sorted and lie within t_span.
            If None (default), use points selected by the solver.
        events (callable, or list of callables, optional):
            Events to track. If None (default), no events will be tracked.
            Each event occurs at the zeros of a continuous function of time and state.
            Each function must have the signature event(t, y) and return a float.
            The solver will find an accurate value of t at which event(t, y(t)) = 0 using a root-finding algorithm.
            By default, all zeros will be found. The solver looks for a sign change over each step,
            so if multiple zero crossings occur within one step, events may be missed.
            Additionally each event function might have the following attributes:
                terminal (bool, optional):
                    Whether to terminate integration if this event occurs. Implicitly False if not assigned.
                direction (float, optional):
                    Direction of a zero crossing.
                    If direction is positive, event will only trigger when going from negative to positive,
                    and vice versa if direction is negative.
                    If 0, then either direction will trigger event. Implicitly 0 if not assigned.
            You can assign attributes like `event.terminal = True` to any function in Python.
        vectorized (bool, optional):
            Whether `fun` is implemented in a vectorized fashion. Default is False.
        options:
            Options passed to a chosen solver.
